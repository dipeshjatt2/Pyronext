Scheduling Tasks
================

Scheduling tasks means executing one or more functions periodically at pre-defined intervals or after a delay. This is
useful, for example, to send recurring messages to specific chats or users.

This page will show examples of how to integrate Pyronext with ``apscheduler``.
For more detailed information, you can visit and learn from the library documentation.
